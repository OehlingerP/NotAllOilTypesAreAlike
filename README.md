This repository is organized as an R package, facilitating convenient reuse. All data utilized in our paper is encapsulated within the package, ensuring straightforward accessibility post-installation. Additionally, all functions are thoroughly documented and accompanied by an R help page. A comprehensive package manual in PDF format is also provided. Furthermore, two vignettes are available—one offering a general overview on package usage and the other guiding the replication of all figures presented in the paper.

## For Economists

Recognizing that many economists may not be familiar with R's package framework, I've included the code in a format standard in our profession. In the "work" folder, a master file is available, executing all subsequent files and generating the results reported in the paper. However, the primary advantage of having a package lies in its well-documented functions and ease of reuse, making it worthwhile to explore.
